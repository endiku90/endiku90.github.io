[DLLs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/deployment/dynamic-link-library) A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls.
